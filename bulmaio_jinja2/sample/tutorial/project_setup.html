    React has become very popular, as has TypeScript. But it can be difficult
    to keep your tools and build configurations up-to-date. Many frameworks
    have recently built CLI (command-line interpreter) tools that make those
    decisions for you, using best practices. They’ll generate a project with
    the right choices then update those choices as things evolve.</p>

    <p> React’s create-react-app takes care of this. And it’s extensible with
        scripts such as react-scripts-ts which provides a TypeScript version of
        the
        generated project.</p>

    <p> In this tutorial step, we use the IDE to generate the project, then
        look at
        the results.

        previews
        of information during autocomplete. The information includes
        docstrings, which helps you recall things without leaving your
        context.</p>
