    React has become very popular, as has TypeScript. But it can be difficult
    to keep your tools and build configurations up-to-date. Many frameworks
    have recently built CLI (command-line interpreter) tools that make those
    decisions for you, using best practices. They’ll generate a project with
    the right choices then update those choices as things evolve.</p>

<p> React’s create-react-app takes care of this. And it’s extensible with
    scripts such as react-scripts-ts which provides a TypeScript version of the
    generated project.</p>

<p> In this tutorial step, we use the IDE to generate the project, then look at
    the results.
