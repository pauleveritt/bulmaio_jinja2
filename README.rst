bulmaio_jinja2
==============

Jinja2 templating for the bulma.io site structure and styling

Bulma is a modern CSS framework and bulma.io is a nicely-structured website.
The bulmaio package extracts the markup, SASS, etc. into a standalone
package.

This package then makes Jinja2 templates, somewhat like components,
which can then be used in a Flask site, Sphinx project, etc.
