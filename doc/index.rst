==============
bulmaio_jinja2
==============

- Modern theme for Sphinx, Flask, or any Jinja2-based system

- Macro-oriented for easy re-mixing

- Single Responsibility Principle

- Lots of small, encapsulated components (data, logic, template, style)

- Uses pydantic to enforce the macro contract

- Less magic, less globals, fail early and obviously

- Resource-based

- IDE and testing "flow"


Future
======

- Replace macros with "components":

    - Self-contained logic+template

    - Override-able in rich ways

- pydantic.future's dataclasses
